# Chapter 2: Major Branches of Science

This chapter provides an overview of the major branches of science. It covers the physical sciences, life sciences, earth sciences, and emerging interdisciplinary fields.

## Overview of Physical Sciences

The physical sciences study non-living systems and include disciplines such as physics and chemistry. Physics is concerned with the fundamental principles of the universe, including the nature and properties of matter and energy. Chemistry, on the other hand, is the study of substances, their properties, how they interact, combine, and change to form new substances.

## Overview of Life Sciences

The life sciences are focused on the study of living organisms. This includes fields like biology, zoology, and botany. Biology is the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution. Zoology is the study of animals, while botany is the study of plants.

## Overview of Earth Sciences

Earth sciences involve the study of the Earth and its atmosphere, including fields like geology and meteorology. Geology is the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change. Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere, weather, and climate.

## Emerging Interdisciplinary Fields

In addition to these traditional branches, there are also emerging interdisciplinary fields that combine aspects of multiple disciplines. These include fields like biochemistry, which combines biology and chemistry, and astrophysics, which combines aspects of astronomy and physics.

In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into key concepts in physics, essentials of chemistry, exploring the life sciences, and Earth and its phenomena. We will also examine the impact of technology in science and look at current trends and future directions in scientific research. This eBook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of science that is both informative and engaging.
